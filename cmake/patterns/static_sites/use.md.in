## Import the package

You can import @PACKAGE_NAME@ as usual with PID. In the root `CMakelists.txt` file of your package, after the package declaration you have to write something like:

{% highlight cmake %}
PID_Dependency(@PACKAGE_NAME@)
{% endhighlight %}

It will try to install last version of the package.

If you want a specific version (recommended), for instance the currently last released version:

{% highlight cmake %}
PID_Dependency(@PACKAGE_NAME@ VERSION @PACKAGE_LAST_VERSION_WITHOUT_PATCH@)
{% endhighlight %}
