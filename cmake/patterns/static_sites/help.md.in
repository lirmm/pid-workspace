## What is this site ?

This is the documentation site of the {{ site.data.package.package_name}} package. A **package** is a git project defining a set of libraries, executables and other software artifacts. 

The site has been automatically generated using Jekyll, configured using CMake and updated/published using GitLab, based on a dedicated development environment called **PID**. Technically, this site has been generated from <a href="{{site.data.package.package_git_project}}" target="_blank">this source repository</a> (you may have no access to the repository project).

In **PID** environment each **package** contains any kind of software artifacts (libraries, executables, configuration files and more generally any kind of filesystem resources). They allow to put into a common place any information about a given project.
