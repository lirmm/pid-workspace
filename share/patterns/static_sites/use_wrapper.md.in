## Import the external package

You can import @PACKAGE_NAME@ as usual with PID. In the root CMakelists.txt file of your package, after the package declaration you have to write something like:

{% highlight cmake %}
declare_PID_Package_Dependency(PACKAGE @PACKAGE_NAME@ EXTERNAL)
{% endhighlight %}

It will try to install last version of this external package.

If you want a specific version (recommended), for instance the currently last released version:

{% highlight cmake %}
declare_PID_Package_Dependency(PACKAGE @PACKAGE_NAME@ EXTERNAL VERSION @PACKAGE_LAST_VERSION_WITHOUT_PATCH@)
{% endhighlight %}
